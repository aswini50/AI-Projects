with [Music] [Applause] Quest and so my quest ends where it began India the southern city of Bangalore is bracing itself for a modern-day pilgrimage of biblical proportions ions of people are on their way to join their spiritual leader his Holiness Shri Shri ravish shanka at his ashra on the outskirts of town his Art of Living Foundation is gearing up to celebrate its 25th anniversary Never Want to Miss a party I've come to soak up the spiritual vibe I can see clearly now the rain is gone now India is not short of a guru or two but when it comes to popularity few can compete with Shri in his white robes even a simple stroll conjures up scenes of some kind of Messiah at night the crowds die down giving me the chance to consult the man they call guruji we're talking about spirituality it seems from what we've seen in this program that more people are searching harder for inner peace these days would you agree correct they want some solay they're looking for some meaning to life that Quest has begun but why now and why more than before I think there at some level people are saturated with the material things that they have been having that's one reason second uh is know whether they are rich or poor everyone wants to be happy and for that they had to go deep inside but is materialism completely inconsistent with spirituality I don't think so that's not uh it's not an impediment you don't have to renounce everything and go to Himalayas to find yourself you can do or you can take care of all your responsibility at the same time find some time for your inner [Applause] nuring with its pure marble Temple shri's ashram currently houses about 6,000 people all are here to take an art of living course and maximize their in a piece meditation breathing techniques and a huge dose of spiritual wisdom there's no getting away from it it's a pretty impressive sight thousands of people over there learning the art of meditation and seeking inner peace it's also a very seductive feeling you can see what they're striving for and yes I'd like to have a little bit of that too the Bri breathing exercises uh I saw some today what do they do what are they geared to be doing you know the link between body and mind is the breath for every Rhythm of the breath there is a particular a state of mind or emotion which is attached you know like when you are agitated you breathe differently when you're angry you breathe differently when you're calm the breath flows different so breathing can energize you make you more alert more aware it sharpens the intellect makes your body and mind uh coordinate better very second day people start seeing the change in them how they feel relaxed and more calm and composed Serene and then the more they practice that becomes um it becomes a more concrete experience it seemed like the perfect antidote for the tired Traveler it takes time though to learn The Art of Living however with the help of my teacher vickram I gave the basics my best shot 3 4 hold 2 3 4 exhale I've never really done anything like this before I've always thought of myself as the sort of practical person but I have to say the deep breathing exercises well it has made me feel better and if I am skeptical about the emotional benefits of doing all of this well I'll keep an open mind the big question is how do I integrated it 4,000 miles away back in my daily life now that's the challenge less of a challenge is the asham's ayurvadic health center if I'm not mistaken my spiritual side was starting to rise up in fact I was positively floating when you walk around your asham people bow I know it's custom to touch your feet do you ever get embarrassed you know it used to in the beginning I I used to be very shy person I would like people praising and you know there's a tradition in India going down you know the way of greeting an elder is to go completely down it's a sometimes a big problem because a person is bowing down the person behind him doesn't see it and he bows down and one fall on the other and it takes me forever to take a short walk not only this I tell you even more that people throw flowers petals at you and of course you need to have some glasses to protect your eyes from those flowers at one place in one of the um Gatherings we told people to don't don't please don't throw flowers you know once it it did hit my eyes you know what I landed up with rice Trish's message of peace and tolerance has spread to more than 140 countries some Skeptics label him as too self-promoting but people from all walks of life are signing up regardless of their religious background the relationship that exists between spirituality and religion it is often one that is confused isn't it because let's take for example The Art of Living um you you you go to Great length to prove out to prove that it is not religious per se would that be fair correct because see spirituality is uh something Beyond religion religion is confined to certain practices uh and symbols it transcends the religious boundaries another thing is though the roots of this knowledge is in Hinduism the yoga and meditation made it so secular in in a sense that people belonging to any religious background Community belief system have no difficulty in getting benefit out of it do you believe that is the way we are probably going to move forward in the future some variant of secular spiritualism absolutely absolutely only that can unite people otherwise if you are confining ourself with limited ideologies or dogmas then you know um you can't be of use to the entire world you can't unite the entire world on my third day in Bangalore the attention shifts this time to a nearby Airfield the 25th anniversary celebrations are only hours away the Sun is setting the seats are filling as far as the eye can see they expect 2 and a half million people here over the next 3 days the scale of this event is simply breathtaking that stage alone holds 3,800 [Music] musicians the evening rolls on spiritual religious governmental leaders preach peace and unity and Shri receives countless blessings there's vadic chanting and of course more meditation and slowly bre [Music] out by the time I make it onto the stage the crowds have been whipped up into a state of mild delirium they're experiencing a true spiritual high and just as I'm trying to reconcile what I'm seeing with the reality of the world's problems his Holiness catches my [Music] eye what happened next was not part of the script I didn't know the words and I certainly wasn't a VIP but there I was next to guruji with a million eyes is wondering who I was it was a fitting end to a fascinating uplifting Journey as human beings we are driven to explore to explain the inexplicable our intelligence means that at times we are doomed to suffer inner turmoil despair disillusionment when answers aren't forthcoming whatever are religious beliefs spirituality is rooted in the ideals of human nature being a better person breathing exercises meditation and prayer they all help us open our minds take stock of who we are and to put life back into perspective and let's face it most of us could do with a bit of that officially my quest is over for another month between you and me it's really just begun [Music]
