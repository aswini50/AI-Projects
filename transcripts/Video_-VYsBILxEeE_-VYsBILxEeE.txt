I had a contion recently which on its own isn't anything new but the source of it was I ran out of Orin cells yeah who would have thought I mean it's not like they're used for [Music] anything oh right the uh the prime weapons well at any rate I need to farm up some more can you imagine someone like me farming for a resource like some kind of mr5 peasant all right so what do we have for options okay we can either do Dark Sector survivals and rely on enemy drops or VOR and krill assassination spamming yeah hey team I'll be in your orbiters in 5 minutes uh cancel all your plans we're going resource farming on it having enough orcin cells to build everything I want is nice and all you know but I want something greater I want to have enough orcan cells to never have to ever farm for them again such as the Creed of all great Warframe players thankfully like all things in Warframe you can build for that so just how hard can we juice our resource output Farm Maxim if you will but before we can do anything what does it mean to drop something let's put this into terms any gamer can understand when you go to the casino all the slot machines have odds to either hit a jackpot hit a regular payout or give you nothing in Warframe there are multiple RNG roles that happen when you kill an enemy and the first one is to determine whether you even get an item or not we'll call this loot chance many trash mobs have very low loot chance while special enemies and bosses can have up to or even higher than 100% drop chances after you pass that loot chance roll then you get access to an enemy's drop tables which include mods endo and of course region resources which are determined by the planet you're on and have varying Rarities to nobody surprise on planets that can drop them orican cells are the rarest resource drop like all things in life the first step to efficient farming requires a down payment that's right we're talking about boosters the blue drop chance booster doubles the chances that all enemies in your mission regardless of whoever kills them will drop something and in the cases where that drop something chance goes above 100% again you have a chance to get more than one loot pull at the same time this Stacks with the yellow resource booster which takes your gained loot from a mission and just multiplies it by two and I mean are these absolutely necessary of course not but you know what they say time is money after all and you've probably got something on your ship that you can trade for more Platinum right right you fool that's a SM kavat he's essential to the entire farming operation these guys are a gambler's best friend because at set intervals they just have a chance to give you one of several Buffs one of which is hacking spitting and throwing up a rare region resource right out of nowhere you can also get an extra 25% Loot drop chance at any relay you just need a resource drop chance blessing bestowed upon you by the generous mr30 or higher player once per day so get out there and start begging for handouts lastly of course is our choice of venue first up is to toggle on steel path obviously not only do all enemies have double the odds of dropping loot but you can also just passively farm arcanes and steal we also want to pick a Dark Sector Mission like Gabby which has a bespoke additional 35% resource drop chance boost so that's our pregame done with these bonuses coming together to give us plus 260% bonus loot chance plus a flat 2x multiplier on top of everything we collect nice now let's talk team comp they're actually a surprising number of frames out there with the ability to get funky with the Warframe drop tables so let's try and squeeze as many of them as we can into our team comp first up is necros obviously this guy's the true blue original farming Warframe thanks to his desecrate ability where he recycles the bodies of your enemies into extra loot now the ability has a base 54% chance to take a corpse and roll on its will I get loot today table but we can increase this when a high enough amount of Slash damage is used to kill an enemy instead of just falling down normally they'll become bced and count as two separate entities for necros so that's an expected 108% increase in our gains right there if we can split and desecrate everybody man necross is kind of messed up isn't he hydroid is also a common farming frame it only makes sense that a pirate would be all about collecting more booty and with the pilling swarm augment he can this gives a 100% chance to roll an enemies loot check again this is by base the best increase and drop chances you can get from an ability so by the laws of Equivalent Exchange it's got to have some Jank to it it the enemies have to be grabbed by tentacles to drop their Loot and the tentacles can't grab xmus units through their overguard but again it effectively doubles your loot compared to just gatting an enemy it's worth trying to play around next our second pilfering augment Warframe it's Kora whose pilfering strangle Dome Works incredibly similar to hydroid tentacles enemies held in the playground structure from Hell have a 60% chance to spin the slot machine again when killed I assume this is lower than hydroids because it pulls enemies into a single area and cor can obliterate every enemy captured with a single button press it's easier to use so you get less reward from it those are the more popular farming abilities but now here's where things get weird you see You'd think that oh I'll just put down hydroids cracking here and then I'll drop a strangle Dome on top of that and then I'll sit necros down in the middle and then I'll get uh 268 of normal drops right the script just says Extremely Loud incorrect buzzer here yeah so no remember what I said about farming profits being inversely related to the amount of suffering you have to go to hydroid and cor augments are both classified as on death meaning they drop their extra loot right as the enemy dies this also means that they don't stack with one another so while you could have both frames on your team fighting over who can grab the most grineer like you're in the merch line on the last day of tennocon we can safely drop one of these two from our farming dream team lineup so we're back to two farming frames who else can we add to the team how about Atlas and his or gaze no not those ones I meant I meant the augment or gaze allows Atlas to not only scan every enemy he hits with his petrify ability into the Codex but breaking the Petrified enemy has a base 25% chance at another slot machine pull which is incredibly low but it does scale with power strength so if you somehow manage to dump insane amounts of strength into him like literally as much as you possibly can you could theoretically reach 100% loot chance with an ability that is very easy to cash in on now you might think this is another on kill farming ability but the wiki is very adamant that this is not the case and that it Stacks with Kora and hydroid's abilities although with hydroid the tentacles just can't grab immobilized enemies and strangledome just doesn't grab petrified enemies so yeah Atlas you're uh you're off the team boting sorry and we've actually got one more Warframe who can Farm one you probably don't expect but actually has insane drop rates by using owl ivara can pickpocket nearby enemies for a guaranteed Loot drop that's pretty huge because you completely skip the drop chance check and go straight into getting loot the glaring downside is that of course you have to position your paper thin ivara in the midst of a bunch of enemies which can result in her getting turned into King su's Deli swiss cheese also you got to take care not to bump into enemies because yeah so that's it then right five farming frames games from which we can make our perfect farming team what no this is a farming video I'm talking about warframes that boost drop chances but it but it's not right you get that no no absolutely not you're already the go-to frame for 90% of content in this game why would I upon further consideration I believe that Wukong as well is a candidate for the farming warframes team don't believe me watch monkey luck has a chance to activate when Wukong dies Reviving him from death and granting him 60 seconds of bonus Loop drops from enemy dude this is ass farming missions go way longer than 60 seconds I can't call you a farming frame just because oh you pie of all right so our team ended up being necros a max range hydroid and a range duration ivara to hide on a wire above the Carnage and pickpocket whoever they can this left one slot open for for the third friend I don't have who plays Warframe who could have played Von speed Nova or mag to specialize in crowd control and getting enemies into our wacky farming Zone this gave us a 208% extra chance at drops from necros and hydroid and ivara who could guarantee an item pull as long as they were close enough to an enemy to steal it from them so let's just call that a plus 50% Loot drop chance boost on average so that gives us 258 % bonus Loot drop chance from our warframes which you can then stack with all our other boosters to give us a grand total of drum roll please 58% which is a lot already right but then you remember that our resource booster applies after all other bonuses and doubles everything for a mindboggling 136% chance increase to to all of our theoretical loot gains but what are our base loot gains surprisingly enough I could find nowhere on the wiki that lists the actual drop chances of Orin cells as region resources so I decided to do a little experiment one run of Gabby on the non-steel path star chart no boosters no blessings No Loot bonuses just a volt and a Helios it was incredibly boring and I got exactly one oric can cell for 30 minutes of work which I honestly wasn't expecting to get that off of Bas drops is pretty lucky but luck for cowards and losers so after that I pulled out my credit card bought a set of boosters and then sat in relays with my friends to beg for resource blessings so um we type in the chat anyone got a little resource drop blessing what emoji should I do I'm going to do the satisfied emoji are you uh factoring in the time it takes to get this blessing into your STS uh oh we should shouldn't we that's not the right one okay I have a better idea what if we all go to different relays and ask for handouts cuz as long as there's one as long as there's one resource drop chance blessing in our party it should count for everyone guys I've got to hit some sick Farm I need this my children will starve otherwise bad face emoji I got it am got it oh thank God oh thank god let's go let's get out of here and with that we were ready according to my calculations I was set to make 10 times the loot I had before but I'll be the first to admit it I was nervous what if my calculations were incorrect what if I didn't get as many cells as I expected and I was right to doubt my math because I didn't get the amount of cells I expected I got way more dude oh I got two more cells oh I got two more cells got one I got two more cells I just got six cells in 20 seconds hey it's working yeah it's working we're up to the estimate I got two more cells I'm rich I'm rich oh oh I just picked up four Orin cells what what insane over here I just pickpocket it I saw it drop off pickpocket on three we do get him we do get him oh that one was four you pickpocketed two Orin cells from that man yeah we found it Zach this is it we'll never have to farm for orcin cells ever again yeah so that estimate of 11 orcin cells for 30 minutes was way off the mark it might have been the unexpected Boon of Ivar's pick pocket or maybe I got really lucky with my SMA kavat procs or maybe it was some form of higher intervention because I walked away from that half-hour survival Mission with 38 Orin cells also mids session we discovered that ivara cannot pick pocket enemies grabbed by hydroid tentacles I'm not even surprised at this point uh something to consider is I thing it doesn't seem to work on things inside the temp so I have to stand before they of course it doesn't wow de you hacks so what's our takeaway here if you stack every single possible farming buff on top of each other it shocker gives you way more loot maybe but I think it also goes to show that in a game like Warframe there's no issue that cannot be solved by Min maxing and to a further extent no issue that cannot be optimized to hell and B back by Min maxing as a team I got an insane amount of Oregon cells from this and my teammates got a good amount too about half my hall since they didn't have a resource booster so we should all be good on having to farm cells for let's say the rest of our Warframe careers but hey if that necessity ever comes around again there's been a blueprint for sales in the marketplace this whole time [Music] oh
