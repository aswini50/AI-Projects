Hello everyone, welcome to another is a prowess video. That came top four of the American RC and uh had a decent win percentage overall in the event. Very strong. Um so not very strong but a very solid choice. You know, blue prowess same list as always. This list hasn't really evolved much. The main deck at this point is very stock. um the sideboard also with the Merkite over the uh Oculus which at some point saw play. Um so yeah, I mean this is just just good old good old blue red prowess. Um if you you know own this deck and know how to pilot it, it's definitely a very good choice for your upcoming regional championship. Um this deck is quick. This deck is fast. Um, if you win the Darl, if you open Cory Bubble, you just doesn't really have that many bad matchup across the board. Um, can you see maybe Lelaya and Sion is bad, but um yeah, we are uh we are uh again just playing a very very stock build. Um, turn one you have 26 one drop. Oh, you have formic growth. I guess that's not really count, but uh, but yeah, I think I believe this is exactly the same as the one that came first in Swiss at the Pro to Art Atlanta. And if I'm not mistaken, there was another one in the top eight too of blue red prowess. Yeah. Uh, there were two blue prow in the top eight. I took the one that made the top four from Sam Clayton, but there's one from Gaj Heette. Same list honestly. Oh, I was playing one surgical main deck. Oh, yeah. Definitely not doing that. What? One surgical main deck. It's crazy. Why would you do that? That prowess mirror in the top eight. Oh. Oh, really? All right. Yeah, we got Cory Bubble broken start. Labyrinth pitch ulapog. Okay. Swift spear. Mhm. Okay. You want to share the link to see the top eight? Sure. It's very easy. Just write on Google. Uh RC RC Houston. Should I go uh um should I go bubble? I don't think so. I should go growth maybe, but I don't think so. So, I'll just go spear go disruptor's flute. Okay. You're naming bubble. You may actually name bubble here. That's why you didn't respond. What do I think of Ulaw and not Siren Ron? No thoughts. They're they're fine. They name Miser's bubble. Makes sense. I'm glad they didn't name Cory to cutter, though. All right, they're passing. Mhm. Um, I'm going to go fiery island. I'll use the scouting power to fetch a surveillance, maybe. Let's hope they don't have another flute. Oh, never mind. The core is here. So, or is here and then I go migen growth on swifty and then F6. I can't play bubble because of the flute that names bubble. It makes sense to name bubble because I can't activate it. the K command of course and then you go dismember on swift spear. Okay. Find a great creator. More haze on me. Sure is bubble minus two and nearing bridge. They got okay they they have no more cards just bridge. I don't feel very good at this game. It's pretty pretty bad. Do I have any outs to bridge? I guess I can burn you. I guess I can burn you. Uh, still killing K though. Yeah. Attack for six down to seven. And then we need to find um, sorry for five. Then we need to find the rest of the burn spells. Classic iteration. Three two drops in our deck with 26 one drop and land. Yeah, pretty anti-statistic, but that's fine. There's like a lot of dead cards anyway after you play bridge. Uh, Mathematic GG from before. Uh, cool. Cool that you play. You played an heating ramp. I don't think I've seen that before. Or maybe I did. Let me see actually. Why is playing so slow? Um, let me see. This is the list that my friend played at the PT. Almost opated. No, he wasn't playing it, but things changed since. All right, I cracked the map. Uh, iteration. Okay. Hand bottom exile. Then I play this. I think I punted here. Should have attacked first. I missed one damage. I missed one damage. Am I playing or casting Antwerp? I'm casting pass. I guess I can play Swirit for one. Yeah, I probably should cash in this damage. Yeah. Yeah. I guess I didn't miss a damage now because if I didn't play iteration, I wouldn't have found the Swiss spear. So, I still got one damage in. Oh, not see her. She's my bubble. Yeah, I'm glad. That's cool. That's cool. Uh lot go. Is there a way my opponent gets stuck with a card in hand? Wow, they actually are. Huh. Unexpected surveail. a priorane. I'm gonna draw it. But I don't want to cast it. Yeah, I think I'm still going to draw it, but I don't want to cast it. I should have drawn first and then surveiled. I made a mistake there, but it's okay. Okay. Uh, let's just attack for one here. So, I'll cast this. I'll cast this. Uh, okay. Uh, yes. Okay. And then I tap with what I have cuz my opponent has one card in hand somehow. I don't know how. Lava darts and such. It would be great. But that's fine. when it goes to two and then post combat I'm playing this preordane survey one I think I don't want this and then resolve the pre-ordain looking for bulls or lava darts and pass stone. I can crack it. But I mean, if they had a cardamom in their hand before, they're probably going to be stuck again this turn. I'm assuming. Okay. Uh, they have two cards in it now. All right. Um, what I'm gonna do is moving Corey on channeler and then attacking and I can also attack with a monk. I guess they two cards. I could have attacked with a monk anyway, but I think it's still better to do this. But oh, maybe this member is the card I have. Yeah, this member could be the card. Mhm. Help survives here, huh? That's funny. Okay. Yeah, I think this member is a guard post combat. I'm going to go pre-ordain a bunch of triggers. Arithlet graveyard. Come on. BS lavads, where are you? Nice. All right. GG. Sideboard against Aldrazi. Trron. Open to memory. Where are we cutting? Also, one violent urge. Maybe, maybe not. I think I got like one, two, one. Something like this. [Music] Keep the lands and spells. We got two cyber cards. We don't cut urges. No, I'm against a combo deck, so I want to So, I'm against a deck with low interaction, so I want to keep the combo. threatening the turn three kill lab put in eyes of the storm expedition map. Okay. Uh, they want to tap out. I don't want to hold up consign just cracks my passes. Is Gabin all right? Wish I kept up consign now. I wish I kept up consign now. thought not sear. Yeah, transphere is definitely a right choice to bring it in. Yeah, 100% on the play especially land. I guess I I should plot this. Yeah. I realized it later. I don't know if I should though cuz then it cost three to cast it. Yeah, maybe it was a mistake to plot it. All right. land. This game seems very very hard. I don't think I'll able I'll I'll ever be able to race this donuts here, especially with those two furry islands. Yeah, Trin won the game easy. I don't I don't think I outs at this point and cast a spell opponent turn I guess and get this first strike. I mean I guess I can double block. I should have played actually Zlickshot. If I play Zickshot, I can urge it and kill the donuts here instead of Swiss spear. The problem is that Uggin is also coming down soon. So I have to hold up three mana for that double block and then I'll urge I'll be this concign. Okay. This member. Yeah. Yeah. All right. Game three. Game three on the play. Um, let's go. I don't want any of these cards on the sideboard. Uh, keep let me start with bubble myself. That's bad. I think I'm actually going to surveil bad. I'm going to hold the bubble uh because I can draw quarry. That's funny. I shuffle to not see the motoic grow and I still had a mutagenic growth on top of my deck. Expedition map. Okay. Huh. I'm going to bubble myself. If I find Corey. Oh, that's awful. If I find Corey, I would have um Trina spear man land. How's it going my friend? What is Trina spear on top? I need to respect it again. I can't uh I can't bolt you. I probably wouldn't have bought you anyway because of that, but I don't know. You probably just have like How many train spheres do you have? Like one. Not that many. You can't have that many training spheres. I don't know. Maybe you do. Okay, you pass. I'm not going to shoot because I need to prowess the asymmetric front lens. Yeah. Well, we're not all perfect. It's okay. That's so many lands. Stop giving me lands. I'm going to go bold dart attack. It's not a game winning play, but unfortunately that's what I got. opponent has training end and pass. Could also considered actually darting again, flashing back because that would have been two more damage. Maybe I draw Cory. They go devourer kicked. Maybe I shouldn't have actually cast the lavadart at all. Actually, are they casting transphere instead? I think vexing bubble. Okay, interesting. Uh, interesting. Let's consign this. Yeah, I should have definitely darted my turn. I think last turn. I don't care about darting in response to bubble. Might as well just use the mana in my turn. Trigger prowess. That's the same damage. All right, let's start by cracking this eyelet. Draw a card. See what I draw. Dart again. Okay, let's go. Mountain swift spear. And then I think I throw everything I have. So, we're going to go dart, dart, dart. The second darts won't resolve, but they will trigger progress. That's all I care. What do they have here? This member. Oh, wow. They do have this member. Okay, they go to one here. They go to one. Yeah, vaccining bubbles saved them. Vexing bubbles saved them here. Okay, five cards at one life. No, it was the same. If we darted in our turn, it would have been the same. No, because then I drew another sweep spear. I guess they dismembered it. So yeah. Yeah. No darting in our turn last turn. But then we didn't use all the mana also cuz I use all the mana this turn. Maybe I mean when the opponent is one life you you made some mistake. That's usually the rule and this rule is always right. If the opponent has one and you lose, you made some mistake. 100%. What was the mistake this game though? Maybe it was that I should have darted the turn before. Yeah. Interesting interesting game I think to start this video cuz we may end up losing. I think I am now. K with so much mana. What can they do? Maybe play training spear. It'd be interesting to replay this game uh with the changes of darting the same turn. Disruptors flute they play. Actually, I'm not going to fetch. If they want to name me Messa, I'll let him do it. I have so many outs. Slick shot show off lightning bolt dart. They named lightning bolt. Okay, I said it a one. Yeah, Javier had the endstone in the sideboard. That's true. That would have won them the game. All right, let's see what I draw. Slick shot. Cory steel cutter. Okay, I hold it in my hand because I want to be able to double spell and attack. Let's see what I do with car donuts here. Okay. Okay. and flu to wear love it. No, lava dart. Okay, we got slick shell show off still as a top deck. Come on, deck. Only one out. Well, four out of I think that's it, right? That's the only out I have. Yeah, only four's league shot. Come on, Dak on the slot. Show off here. Boom. Hog. Hog. No. No. I have K command. Did I K command? GG. Thank you magical line though for the maximum show. I appreciate the effort of showing maximum entertainment. Okay, that's a good end. I'm going to keep uh what are we bottoming? I think I'll bottom lava dart. Yeah. 17 and cast a pre-order day in turn one. Looking for a mish bubble. There it is. Wow. I love both of these cards actually. Cool. No. Where is this like a vexing bubble man? Vaccin bubble stops two of my five cards. I think I still have to though. Sacrifice that Mishra's bubble for two two haste. Man, this bubble is so annoying. Thank you. Uh, bora grays are strong. strong blocker. Um, I think I keep on pushing. I can go slick shot muteni growth or I can go channeler brierane. I think slick shot mug genenic growth pushes more. But I think I'm I'm in a I'm in a lot of trouble here. Oh, this M will not resolve. Yeah, the vaccin bubble saved my opponent so much damage already. but has three amulets of two amulets of vigor. Lizfield. I think I would have still lost even if uh my opponent didn't have the vaccine bubble. Honestly, that a turn three kill. Does bringing violent urge. That's probably it. Uh, Wildlander. I think this is a Mulligan. This is probably the cheapest competitive deck at the moment. Maybe. No. One swift spear. Actually, is throne swift spear the best play? Cuz I can also go pre looking for a bubble to trigger Cory because turn two core is pretty bad. I'm still going to go see it. It does three damage overall. If I go turn two prior survey landeration is bad in this match. I'm going to free orane. I think it's better than going Cory go. You want to say in consign? Yeah, you can say in consignion pretty channeler. Cher is not in the liarium, but it triggers Cory. It's maybe okay. It can give me the turf four kill this channeler. Okay, Magen is very strong. I can go Cory Channeler. Would I go unogenic growth? That's the question. Um, I don't think so. It triggers prowess prowess, but I think next turn it can deal more damage. Although still probably won't be able to deal 12. We'll see. Is that going to be good me against amulet? No. Why? You need to kill them fast. But let's see. Hey, this deck is not good against combo. If you plan on making the day of the week hopper uh Monday on Mango's Workshop, there's a video every okay Zenith for grazer strong. You can subscribe to Mango's Workshop and wait until 9:00 p.m. today. We have a a popper video. I don't play Magical Light. It doesn't do well in the videos, unfortunately. Okay, that's a lot of people. That's a lot of people. All right, let's begin with iteration and let's see where it leads to. Graveyard. This is all pretty bad cards. The vexing bubble has been such a beating. I I don't have many options. So, let's play bubble gets countered. Surveills. Stop. All right. Um H what next? If I play Jenny Growth. Yeah, I think I'm going to do that. I'm going to do a land uh attack play growth. Then if there's an extern, I should be a core spell. Uh yeah, I'm going to go fetch. Is this where we see the stomping ground tech? I didn't think about it. I didn't think about it. I did not think about it. Oh my god. You are right. Stomping ground in my deck. How do you think about it? Is it lethal? You you said in last game all is it little set? I think it's not lethal though. It's not lethal, but what else am I supposed to do, right? So, let's just go for it. Wow. Stomping around tech, huh? Crazy stuff. I think you got a two, not mistaken. Three. Sure. Yeah, we love a dark surveil with a one. Yeah, that's true. Uh, Titan two amulets. I'll concede. I mean, one on turn three and four. I think it's pretty average for amulet. It's the thing is that I can also win on turn three and four. I just didn't do that. The vaccine bubble stopped me. I think both games. I think first game I would have still lost even if they had didn't have the vaccine bubble, but the second game I would have definitely won. round number three. Little bit on the par this hand, but I mean I don't think I'm going to Let's keep it burned. Attack pass. Vexing bubble. Three opponents in a row with a vexing bubble. Okay. Okay. Okay. Uh let's go top land. Uh pre-ordain I think is better than nothing. A attack pass. Yeah, preodern is going bigger in your region. Nice. Yeah, preodern super popular in Italy as well. Flesh raker or K command. Flesh raaker. Thank god it's not K command. All right, let me bold this. Okay, now I draw pre-ordain. I go Cory pre-ordain attack. Yeah, that's the to lose a tournament with commander. Yeah, with black lotus first prize. That's cool. Last year I went there. Friend of mine actually lost the final for the for the black lotus. Pretty brutal. Well, the second place was 40 dual, so I guess not too bad either. Oh, split. They actually played it all for the Lotus. Crazy. Uh, mission growth. I don't want it. I guess this should have fetched for the stomping ground though. Flesh rager is back and pass important. I don't think you'll win. Uh maybe maybe you will. Who knows lethal? Uh, let me go lava dart here. Oh, actually it doesn't flash back. Uh, let me go bold here. Dart base. Uh, it was banned in legacy and restricted in vintage. Yeah, vaccin bubble. I mean, the the mox champion had four vaccine bubble in his deck. I've trimmed that deck. I've streamed this deck last week. We trophed it. We trophed with four vaccin bubble in our deck. Okay, let's bring four consign. Do I want to cut mutagenic growth? Actually, I think I will. I think my opponent plays a [ __ ] a lot of um plays a lot of uh vaccine bubble. So, Mhm. What else am I bringing in? A couple of annoying heats. Yeah, they have toilets here and flesh raker at least that I've seen. Why do I cut the urges? I think against the high interactive decks, but I want to cut it against the vaccine bubble as well. Yeah. They're probably looking for lands here. All right. Ancient tube. Hopefully no ch one. Okay. Um [Music] I don't know. Pass. Maybe not. Maybe I should just play play my cards and hold the consign only for the big bombs. But if they go ton here on turn two, I kind of lose the game, I think. Although it's it's actually unlikely that it happens. I still think I should just go land. I can always surveil. Oh yeah, that has to be countered. H. Um, the big basic mountain is fine. I'm going to go channeler Briane. A third land. Third land would be necessary. Kind of feel like a waste though of surveilling. So, let's just bin this. And then if I never draw third land, I'll regret. Okay, there's the third land. That's good. What about lightning bolt? Medium. Medium. I'm going to bottom it. I do want to draw the third land next turn. Oh. Oh, see there. Maybe that bolt was not that bad. I take lava dart. Noent in the graveyard. No, it's it's fine. We didn't take both is not that good. [Music] I think I'm going to go for your Dane. Yeah, this this this this t here stops me very much here. I'm going to surveil end of turn. I guess I should just reveal main phase one actually. Yeah, that was a mistake. I didn't notice that at three times. I thought I only have two. She'll survive main phase cuz if I find creature artifact, I get the L. Uh unofficial Johnny D. Thank you for that. If you want sub, welcome. Yeah, I would have gotten a delirium. I still think I should bin this even though it's not that bad. I just want to get delirium. I missed three damage here. Opponent's at 20 though. Ooh, Cory H. Yeah, let's just go Cory Swiftear to get the token out. I'll put this iteration later. I think as long as I have things to do, I should do them. I don't like bolt. F6. Should I jump attack? I think so. TKS Hy are very good. all this dust. Oh no. has no cards in end, but they have Uggin and Devar below those labyrinth. [Music] I don't think I can ever win this game. Let's just go to the next one on the play against Alderon. Do I stand by my sideboarding? Yeah, that's cool. again. Keep uh I want to say I want to bottom the lava dart. Yeah. and let it Oh, Chaz 36 months. Thank you, Chaz. Welcome. Welcome. Three years. It's a lot of time. Thank you. Thank you. All right. Uh what's the play now? Uh click on strong. Okay. Go double swear. Then I can go iteration. I think I got double swear. The reason being uh well there's also always the chance of drawing bubble and double swear is broken. But if not, if I go Cory, if I go Cory pass and then I go double Swiss spear, I think it's like the same amount of damage as going Swiss spear into iteration into spell. What's going on? Okay. Yeah, I think this is best. Go. We're going iteration. Okay. Uh, do I prefer to go preordane bolt or hold up consign? I think hold up consign now. So I'm going to go bolting end bottom Stevens untapped then hold up consign for a train or a thut here and next I can go Cory bolt pre Cory pre but I think I'm pretty lethal if I go Cory Bolt I don't think I put it in the turn. Just cycle kick command. Sure. Multron. Whatever they cast, I'm going to consign on top win. I didn't do the math. I'm pretty sure it's lethal. Yeah, actually minus one. It should be. Yeah. GG. Pretty clean. Clean kill. Actually, minus two. What's minus two? Daniel, when's the uh when's the Canadian RC? I was just blink league. It was fine. It was fine. We didn't do too well, but a very close games. Went two, but was a Every time I play Just Sky, it's always impressive. Okay, round four on the play. Very good in keep a bottom lava dart. channel [ __ ] bubble music grow bubble bubble I may slur roll the bubble. I guess I'm going to bubble now. Maybe. We'll see. We'll see. Maybe I want to find the liium, you know. Or bubble. I don't think I want a mutagenic growth into open mana. Even though if I find like a sorcery. No, definitely not. Should I cast? Yeah, I think I keep on casting bubbles because if I find a sorcery or a creature, I get delirium. Ah, this is too good. I just attack pass. I want to play around. Have I tried riftbound? I don't. No, I played two games already and it's too many. I play Magic and Flesh and Blood and I can only afford to do that because it's my actual job, but playing two games is a lot. So, a third one. I mean, if I'm paid, sure. But if I'm not paid, nah, aqualus. Oh. Well, that's not bad if you have an earth or persist. I still have a very good draw there or steel top of my deck. Yeah, Faba is a great game. Yesterday they announced a new thing. I need to catch up on that. I haven't seen the announcement cuz I think it happened at midnight for me and I just woke up so I don't know. I haven't I haven't heard about it. They made a new format called Silver Age. Emperor of Bones. H sure. Now cycle all these bubbles. growth. That's fine. AO the mind bitten also known as Superman Spider-Man draw three recall Corey. Let's go. Bubble land to the bin. Trigger. Yes. A. Yes. I still didn't find the delirium. Oh my god. All right. Um, mutagenic ear. And I find delirium. Sorcery creature creature. Let's go. And then attack. I don't know how much damage it is. It may be over or not. It's not over. Opponent still fights looting. Conceit. Okay. So, I've got a surgical extraction. Anything else I have? One. Swap ears. Anything else I have? two spells and errors. And that's it. Cards to cut. I think I'm cutting um Sutagenic Growth, one dart, one urge. Yeah, let's do this. Let's just make the the package a little bit tinier. All right, let's go. Keep What should I do on turn two? How about ah I think pass. I think I should pass. I think I have frog. They don't have frog. Okay. and they're at the aulus. Oh my god. [Applause] Yeah. Honestly, this is GG. I'm fast forwarding to game three. Not beating that in my hand currently. I keep this hand. I go turn one channeler bubble. See a second land. What do I do on turn two? I can go channeler hold up spells near or I can go slick shot mogenic growth or I can mulligan. I think malan is better. Is it a dart or I think it's dart. I'm going to keep the combo urge mutagenic growth to oneshot an opponent. What deck am I playing today? Uh, that's my last league. I've played just kept blink before. Usually I do two leagues a day. Bring bolt. Uh, pin is not bad. Bolt is definitely bad. Pain, I think I'll draw it. Next, I can go pre-ordain and then hold up for the um psychic frog. Go pane. Double quarry. I definitely draw one. I don't think I need another one. Plant go. I did keep the doctor away. It definitely does not give the doctor away. I every time cold temperatures come, I always catch cold and I don't know all sort of winter illness just by the two leagues a day. All right, they're going to go frog. No looting. Okay, just never cast two drops into my open mana. Two lands. Okay. The doctor would increase the medicine four leagues a day. Yeah. Swiss spear. H. Okay. I definitely need P spells near. I think they have something. I don't want to tap out. Maybe I should. Should I tap out? I definitely want to draw this this Swiss spear though. Yeah, let's tap out. Let's go Corey Swiss spear. They go frog. I think I can beat that. If they go looting archon, I'll lose and complain. Horse of despair. Habana. Sure. That was unexpected. And then Aquulus. Oh my god. Oh my god. Force bear into Aquulus. That's brutal. Not the worst. Let me draw a card. Hello, James. I think I go lava dart here in flashback. Nah, it's not dirty and pass. And pass. Now we're still not too far away from winning. The opponent puts the guard down. Oh, wow. Archon hit the bin with the manifest from Oculus. With the manifest dread. Oh, wow. They don't attack with Oculus. Okay, they do. All right, I'm taking Nope. They're thinking about it. Okay. Wow. No attacking with Oculus. Crazy. Uh I think block. Yeah, cuz like this token is moving around next turn. It's just going to be a one one go for frog. I think the idea on turn two just lit around spells near on turn two unear on top of the deck. Okay, another bold. Let's do that. I think I'll bold the frog. Uh, I don't want to land. Although, if they discard two cards, if suck a land, I think it's fine to suck a land. I discard two. Oh, they don't discard two. Okay, that's I guess they have an earth. What's this? Oh, another Olus. Okay. Well, not that much. Okay. Yeah, I think this is going a little bit too complicated now. Even with the combo urge, mutagenic growth, I don't think I can do it. I can block and pump. I don't think it's a good play though. Yeah. No heat. I didn't sight it in. I should have. I should have sided in. Uh, I think it's over. I don't think I can overcome that. I think it's over. Yeah, Okaloosa has destroyed me today. GG, opponent. GG. All right, I'm going to wrap it up here. Uh, some some close matches, I guess, except the one against Amula Titan. Uh, nonetheless, you know, this list is solid. Yeah, with a with a less vexing bubble against you, you can you can have some wins. I hope you had fun watching this video. If you want to subscribe to the channel, make sure to do so. And I'll see you next time.
