[Applause] you must be very disappointed these days do I look disappointed I want you no the world is not going your way I have patience and perseverance I know it will come how old are you guess guess can you guess no because you have patience you mean the word is destroying itself don't you feel so I'm little over half a century but I still have few more years and I'm sure people will because you know everybody wants peace peace is a innate need of people but they don't know how to get rid of the negative emotions negative Tendencies anger and frustration that education is needed in the world today you know to teach people how to let go of the negativity let go the past and move to the Future your quoted to measure success by seeing a smile and you're smiling all the time meaning that you are a success story but doesn't mean anything about our world the world is not smiling anymore I know and there is a lot of work that is needed to be done you know there is a work for the reformers there are doctors are there in the world and they have their job to treat the patients and if the doctors fall sick there is no no hope for patience so uh even few people if we lose our smile we cannot bring smile into the face of the others so we need to be centered we need to work hard to bring the smile back into the face of the people when you're saying let's stop the world for an hour for 10 days what do you mean by that stopping our mind stop the Mind know it's racing it's always thinking about the past or anxious about the future we are angry about the past or anxious about the future to take a fresh look at the world to the situation you need to wake up and see as Mahatma Gandhi used to say they never turn back and look say now let's see what we should do now and for the future that gives a lot of energy encouragement enthusiasm and lifts you up from the ashes even though there are ales around and all this starts with India and India exactly perhaps it may be in other parts of the world as well no I I wonder so many of our children are going to India and I I I don't know why why are they so fascinated with the place you know India has a long history of U spiritual upliftment when when you see that everything is collapsing and that all doors are shut set and there are no hope no dep and depression sets sin India gives a vision of you know something higher and the possibility the power of your own thought the power of your mind and how you can create your reality your world and move in that direction you may not be successful immediately tomorrow but the vision and a mission always takes you forward you known as a one who tries to bridge between the business world and the political world is it bridgeable at all no basically we are all human beings there is a humanness in everybody and I feel the reformers the rulers and providers they all have to work together only then Society can really uh come together and are you a little concerned about this mixture between politician and business and sometimes it brings corruption we know it in this country they know it in other Western countries everywhere even in India there is corruption a lot of corruption you know corruption begins where the sense of belongingness ends you draw a circle of belongingness around you and your corruption begins only after that and politicians need to be more spiritual spiritual I I mean have a sense of belongingness for people you know what Mahatma Gandhi uh gave in the centuy just this lesson he is a spiritual person at the same time he was a politician too and he had the sense of sacrifice you know I want nothing for myself but I want for my people that spirit is somewhere going down and that's why we feel that uh sort of corruption and the sort of unethical businesses have all sprung up we need to inculcate again those value system both in business because for business trust is the backbone and if the trust is broken business you know what we saw in last 10 months it took almost 10 years for communism to collapse it took less than 10 months for capitalism to collapse and the reason is we have ignored value system ethics in business we have IGN note that human values of caring and sharing of dedication and devotion these values somehow we can recate in our youth actually youth are very ready for and youth wants this because they saw what they see among the older generation just running after it's like running on the treadmill going nowhere what's so wrong about present current world leadership and perhaps our Vision leadership I would say that sense of belongingness is shrinking somewhere more self-centered self-serving attitude than sacrifice a sense of sacrifice for the cause vision and Mission is is really lacking you said once that forgiveness is a cue is forgiveness is the formula to make peace between Israel and Arabs let go the past and find a new future from Independence to interdependence that's what we need to understand you know Independence was a slogan of the past era everyone want to be independent so that they could be prosperous but today Prosperity doesn't come from Independence it comes from in understanding the interdependency and if this education is brought to people and also see there is an identity crisis the main thing is a person thinks I am a Muslim or I am a Christian or a Hindu Buddhist those who are not this they no longer belong to me they look like an enemy they need to shift this to first and foremost identity we are all human beings then we belong when they are this gender male or female then the Third identity we belong to this religion or that religion then this nation or that if the priority of identity is in the right place I think conflicts can be resolved very very quickly how would you like to see The Stereotype of the future leader I feel through education we can change the unite the hearts and minds of people and this cannot be done with from people who are in power people who are in Authority cannot unite the hearts and minds of people it's the volunteers voluntary organizations social workers reformers they have to bring this change in people of bringing the change of mindset uniting them bringing hearts and Minds together are you optimistic like Jimmy W I'm realistic and that means that means that you are pessimistic no absolutely not optimism is just a hope but when you see it is possible it's practicable then I see I'm realistic it's going to happen see people cannot stand tension or stress for too long somewhere one has to give up you can't hold your fist too long like that somewhere you have to relax and when you relax you see the whole sky on your head that that uh tendency is began in the world if you see between France and Germany and in Western Europe there was so many conflict in the previous era but now the borders have gone it's become one currency which was Unthinkable in the 19th century so in same way I'm very I'm sure Middle East crisis could be solved through educating people in a multicultural multi- religious broader spectrum of knowledge you're always smiling and giving such a warm impression or there are some other times you know this is my weakness you are pointing out to my weakness sometimes you need to show anger but I cannot do that I try to do it but then you know I end up laughing so it's been quite a disadvantageous thing for me you know you can be taken for a ride on this ladies and gentlemen thank you very much thank you
